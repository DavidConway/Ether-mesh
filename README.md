# Ether Mesh

## Outline

Ether Mesh is made up of two main elements. The protocols and standards.

Ether mesh is designed to brake up the development of elements needed to display spatial XR/AR content. It split up development into content development (Ether fiber / Ether weaver), content hosting and storage (Ether string), client routing and content management (Ether knot), and displaying / interaction with content by the client (Ether glass).

The goal is that If multiple developers are all using the protocols and following the same standard, their work will all be compatible and can work together without the need for the developers to collaborate directly.

The Protocols are basic rules and fundamentals of how communication between each element of the Ether Mesh. This will include data transfer data format, ports to be used, and other such fundamental elements. Protocols, once set, will not be changed except in critical situations. This will allow for the expansion and evolution of ether mesh while remaining backward compatible

The Standards are a set of functional rules that a given implementation of an Ether element must support in order to be considered an Ether element. This would cover what types of data an element can resave/send/understand. Examples of this would be a list of data tags and what the data associated with it is for and rules such as what kinds of 3d models can be received/ sent.
